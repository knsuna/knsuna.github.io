In this WOD, we had to create an invoice. This includes 4 different products with different prices and add them together. This WOD was very different from the previous WODs (BrowserHistory 1,2,3,6). Here is a link to the page with further instructions: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html

This WOD took me a while. I was kind of able to see the direction that the instructions wanted me to go in. However, I struggled in the section that talked about generating the product rows. I found it hard to understand what it was trying to do. This section probably took me the longest time to complete, but after trying things out, I was able to figure out what was going on.

To prepare for this WOD, I first read the instrcutions and try to forumlate some type of strategy that I wanted to use to create the invoice. I usually try to prepare by skimming over, but for this WOD, I had to google some stuff beforehand. 

I think that next time I should try to spend more time researching the WOD beforehand. I found that the more time I spend doing it, the faster I can finish.
