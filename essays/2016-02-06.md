The biggest reason why I decided to be an MIS major is becuase I love working with computers. All of my jobs in my career have involved working heavily with computers. From back-end software like Jamf to front-end support like computer support are all things that I am deeply interested in. I could not imagine a career not doing anything computer related and for this reason, I chose MIS.
