1. What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?
I think that what I accomplished was better than what was planned. I did have a plan about what I wanted to do, however, it turned out much better than I could have expected. I really liked the cart function that I was able to complete in the website. I think that it was much better than what I expected.

2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
I think that everything that I wanted to add was done on the website. If I had more time, I would have liked to add a manager page. However, I spent so much time trying to perfect the other parts and I ended up running out of time. Although I could have pushed it, I felt like if I did, it would have been super buggy.

3. What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?
I think that the biggest risk of this project the cart function. There are so many things that I could have done which would have either added more or less diffuculties. However, I think the method that I used was the simplest to accomplish this task.

4. What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?
I think that my system is very good. I tested it multiple times and there are no issues. Additionally, I think that all of the functionality of the website is very clean and is very easy for customers to use.

5. What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?
I think that this system would most likely need more security. Although I think that I did a decent job, I could have definetly done more.

6. Describe what you are most proud of about this project:
I am most proud of the cart function. I spent so much time thinking and coding how it should look. There were so many issues that I had to troubleshoot and I think that I did a really good job.

7. Describe what you are least happy with this project:
If there was something that I was least happy about, it would be the amout of time I wasted on smaller things that were really not hard. I feel like if I was able to fix them faster, I could have spent more time on other things. 

8. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. "I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization"):
I did not work in a group.
