I think my programming skills have improved.Since the start of my class, I would have to agree that my programming skills have greatly improved. I think that the main reason for this is becuase now I can kind of game plan what I want to do. By knowning what I want to try to achieve, it allows me to reasearch and review what I need to do beforehand.

Yes, I am enthusiastic about programming. It is very challenging and sometimes requires research, but I think it a nice challenge to.

I can kind of do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions. I can pretty much finish the WODs after 1 or 2 attempts, but I like to watch the screencast afterwards to make sure I did everything correctly.

I am able to complete the labs with confidence. However, there are some cases where I need to go back and review the recordings to make sure that I understand the concepts correctly.

I think that I may be able to move onto the next stage of complex programming. For example in Assignment 1, I kept on trying different things and I had to search up on the internet different methods to perform what I wanted to do. 

I think the class is great already. I think that I am getting everything that is being taught.

I really liked the zoom recordings. They helped when I was having issues with the Assignments.
